# Agent Communication Directory

This directory is for asynchronous communication between agents and the engineering manager.

## How to Ask Questions

1. **Create a question file** with format: `q[number]-[brief-description].md`
   - Example: `q001-java-setup-issue.md`
   - Example: `q002-opengl-crash-help.md`

2. **Use the question template** (see `question-template.md`)

3. **Include all relevant information:**
   - What you were trying to do
   - What error you encountered (with full error messages)
   - What you've already tried
   - Your system info (OS, Java version, etc.)

## How Answers Work

- Engineering manager will periodically check this directory
- Answers will be provided as `answer-q[number].md`
- You'll see the answer file appear next to your question

## Tips

- **Be specific** - include error messages, file paths, commands you ran
- **Include context** - what ticket were you working on?
- **Attach files** if needed - screenshots, logs, config files
- **One question per file** - easier to track and answer
- **Don't delete answered questions** - they help other team members
