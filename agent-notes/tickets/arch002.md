# ARCH-002: Rust+wgpu Hello Triangle Prototype

## Description
Create a minimal Rust application using wgpu to render a basic triangle. Based on findings from ARCH-001, wgpu-rs offers better development velocity and native Rust design compared to bgfx-rs.

## Context & Previous Research
This ticket builds on **ARCH-001** findings which identified wgpu-rs as a more pragmatic choice for the architecture migration:
- **Development Time**: 2-4 hours vs 8-16 hours for bgfx
- **Native Rust Design**: Built for Rust, not C++ bindings
- **Better Documentation**: Active Rust gamedev community
- **WebGPU Standard**: Future-proof API

**Reference**: [Vision: Next-Generation Game Engine Architecture](../AGENT_README.md#vision-next-generation-game-engine-architecture)

## Requirements

### 1. Rust Project Setup
- Create new Rust project: `cargo new viklings-wgpu --bin`
- Configure Cargo.toml with wgpu dependencies
- Set up proper project structure for comparison with bgfx approach

### 2. wgpu Integration
- Initialize wgpu instance, adapter, device, and queue
- Create surface for window rendering
- Set up render pipeline with basic shaders
- Verify cross-platform compatibility

### 3. Triangle Rendering
- Create vertex buffer with triangle geometry
- Write WGSL shaders (vertex + fragment)
- Implement render pass with triangle draw
- Maintain 60 FPS render loop with proper frame pacing

### 4. Comparison Analysis
- Document setup complexity vs bgfx-rs and Java/LWJGL
- Measure performance characteristics
- Assess development experience and tooling
- Provide migration recommendation

- **Platform Differences**: Surface creation varies - use winit helpers

### Comparison Challenges  
- **Fair Assessment**: Different APIs may need different approaches
- **Performance Baseline**: Need consistent measurement methodology
- **Subjective Factors**: Developer experience is partly subjective

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Setup time: < 4 hours (as predicted)

- Binary size: Reasonable for graphics app

### Qualitative
- Documentation clarity: Better than bgfx-rs
- API intuition: Easier than C++ bindings
