# TOOL-001: Screenshot Tool for Agent Visual Feedback

## Description
Create a screenshot tool that allows agents to capture the game window for visual verification during development. This enables agents to validate graphics changes without requiring human visual inspection.

## Problem Statement
Current development limitation: Agents can compile and run graphics applications but cannot see the visual output. This creates a feedback gap where agents cannot verify:
- Triangle rendering correctness
- Movement and animation
- UI layout and positioning  
- Color and visual effects
- Sprite rendering and positioning

## Solution Overview
Create a cross-platform screenshot utility in `agent-notes/agent-tools/` that can:
1. Capture screenshots of specific application windows
2. Save screenshots with descriptive filenames
3. Work with the existing wgpu triangle renderer from ARCH-002
4. Be easily callable by agents during development

## Requirements

### 1. Screenshot Tool Development
- **Location**: `agent-notes/agent-tools/screenshot.sh` (macOS/Linux) and `screenshot.bat` (Windows)
- **Functionality**: Capture window by process name or window title
- **Output**: Save timestamped PNG files to `agent-notes/screenshots/`
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for common failure cases

### 2. Platform Support
- **macOS**: Use built-in `screencapture` command
- **Linux**: Use `scrot`, `gnome-screenshot`, or similar
- **Windows**: Use PowerShell or built-in screenshot tools
- **Fallback**: Full screen capture if window-specific fails

### 3. Integration Testing
- **Target Application**: Test with viklings-wgpu triangle renderer
- **Validation**: Capture triangle at different positions/states
- **Documentation**: Usage examples and troubleshooting guide
- **Agent Workflow**: Demonstrate agent can use tool effectively

## Technical Specifications

### Tool Interface
```bash
# Basic usage - capture specific window
./agent-tools/screenshot.sh "viklings-wgpu"

# With custom filename
./agent-tools/screenshot.sh "viklings-wgpu" triangle-test-1

# Full screen fallback
./agent-tools/screenshot.sh --fullscreen
```

### Expected Files Created
```

├── agent-tools/
│   ├── screenshot.sh         # macOS/Linux implementation  
│   ├── screenshot.bat        # Windows implementation

### Success Criteria - Platform Detection
- [ ] Correctly detects operating system (macOS/Linux/Windows)
- [ ] Uses appropriate screenshot command for platform
- [ ] Handles missing dependencies gracefully
- [ ] Provides clear installation instructions if needed

### Success Criteria - Window Capture  
- [ ] Successfully captures viklings-wgpu window by name
- [ ] Window appears correctly in saved PNG file
- [ ] Triangle is visible and properly rendered
- [ ] Colors and geometry match expected output

### Success Criteria - Agent Integration
- [ ] Agent can run screenshot tool from command line
- [ ] Screenshots save to predictable location
- [ ] Agent can read and analyze screenshot files
- [ ] Tool works in agent development workflow

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: macOS Implementation (Primary Platform)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# screenshot.sh for macOS
WINDOW_NAME="$1"
FILENAME="${2:-screenshot-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)}"
OUTPUT_DIR="agent-notes/screenshots"

mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR"

# Try window-specific capture first
if [[ -n "$WINDOW_NAME" ]]; then
    # Use screencapture with window selection
    screencapture -l$(osascript -e "tell application \"$WINDOW_NAME\" to id of window 1") \
        "$OUTPUT_DIR/$FILENAME.png"
else  
    # Fallback to interactive selection
    screencapture -i "$OUTPUT_DIR/$FILENAME.png"
fi
```

### Phase 2: Cross-Platform Support
- Add Linux support with `scrot` or `gnome-screenshot`
- Add Windows support with PowerShell screenshot
- Create unified interface script that detects platform

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
- Test with running viklings-wgpu application
- Verify agent can capture triangle at different states
- Document common usage patterns

## Validation Plan

### Manual Testing
1. **Launch Triangle**: Start viklings-wgpu triangle renderer
2. **Capture Screenshot**: Use new screenshot tool to capture window
3. **Verify Result**: Confirm triangle is visible in saved PNG
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Window minimized, multiple windows, etc.

### Agent Testing  
1. **Agent Execution**: Agent runs screenshot tool via command line
2. **File Analysis**: Agent reads screenshot file and confirms creation
3. **Integration Test**: Agent runs triangle → takes screenshot → validates
4. **Documentation**: Agent documents successful workflow

## Expected Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Window Detection
- **Problem**: Finding specific application window among many
- **Solution**: Multiple detection methods (PID, window title, process name)

### Challenge: Timing Issues  
- **Problem**: Screenshot taken before window fully renders
- **Solution**: Add delay options and retry mechanisms

### Challenge: Platform Differences
- **Problem**: Different screenshot tools across OS
- **Solution**: Platform detection and tool abstraction

### Challenge: Permissions
- **Problem**: Screenshot permissions on modern OS (especially macOS)
- **Solution**: Clear permission setup instructions

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements
- Screenshots successfully capture game window 95% of the time
- Tool works across development platforms
- Clear error messages for failure cases
- Documentation enables easy agent adoption

### Agent Development Impact
- Agents can now visually verify graphics changes
- Reduced need for human visual inspection
- Faster development iteration for visual features
- Foundation for automated visual testing

## Deliverables

2. **Documentation**: Usage guide and troubleshooting 
3. **Test Results**: Validation with viklings-wgpu triangle
4. **Agent Workflow**: Demonstrated integration in development process
5. **Screenshots**: Example captures showing tool effectiveness
